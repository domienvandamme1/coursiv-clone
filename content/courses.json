              "content": "Hey there, I'm Alex! Today, we're diving into the world of ChatGPT, an advanced large language model (LLM).\n\nChatGPT is an AI tool created by OpenAI that can understand and generate human-like text. Think of it as a super-smart writing assistant that can help you with almost anything — from drafting emails to brainstorming ideas.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nChatGPT was trained on millions of texts from the internet, books, and articles. It learned patterns in language, which allows it to predict what words should come next in a sentence. When you type a message (called a \"prompt\"), ChatGPT reads it, understands the context, and generates a helpful response.\n\n**Key things to know:**\n\n• ChatGPT doesn't actually \"think\" — it predicts the most likely next words\n• The better your prompt, the better the response\n• It can make mistakes, so always double-check important information\n• It works best when you give it clear, specific instructions\n\nReady to try it out? Let's move to your first exercise!",
